# seoul-logger

<p> A very small c++ logging class which can be used in a DLL application and a console only app aswell</p>
Here's how it looks like:

<h2> Warning! </h2>
 This Logger is very new and I'm not that insane good at c++. So keep in mind, that it isn't the best code.
 There are also a few bugs I think, I'm looking forward to fix everything and add some more features!

<h2> How do I use this? </h2>
There is a Example.cpp which contains everything you need to know. If u still have some more questions, feel free to ask! :)

<h2> Features? </h2>
Currently the Logger can do these things:
<br>1. Logging in a console (obv) </br>
<br>2. Logging in a file with the location of the target exe (if u have a DLL to inject somewhere) </br>
<br>3. Logging in a file where you can give the path </br>
<br>4. Multiple log level with color support</br>
<br>5. Some helper functions to print hex and dec values </br>
