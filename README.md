# seoul-logger

<p> A very <s>small</s> c++ logging class which can be used in a DLL application and a console only app aswell</p>
Here's how it looks like:

<h2> Warning! </h2>
 This Logger is very new and I'm not that insane good at c++. So keep in mind, that it isn't the best code.
 There are also a few bugs I think, I'm looking forward to fix everything and add some more features!

<h2> How do I use this? </h2>
There is a Example.cpp which contains everything you need to know. If u still have some more questions, feel free to ask! :)

<h2> Features? </h2>
Currently the Logger can do these things:
<ol>
 <li> Logging in a console (obv) </li> 
 <li> Logging in a file with the location of the target exe (if u have a DLL to inject somewhere)  </li> 
 <li> Logging in a file where you can give the path  </li> 
 <li> Multiple log level with color support </li> 
 <li> Some helper functions to print hex and dec values  </li> 
 <li> Multiple logger objects </li>
 <li> Changing colors of the different levels (soon) </li>
</ol>

<h2> What features are planned? </h2>

<h2> Why did you do this? </h2>
This is actually my first ever project on GitHub. I wanted to publish something and I haven't coded a logger ever, so I decided to do that.


<h2> Why tf is this code so bad? </h2>
When I start coding on a project I don't want it to be perfect. I firstly make it work and then revisit it and fix everything up. Then I try to optimize everything.
